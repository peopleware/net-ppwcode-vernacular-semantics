    /// A type that formalizes how to work with objects that represent real-world objects
    /// (objects with semantic meaning, non-utility objects, non-value objects).
    /// </summary>
    /// <remarks>
    /// <para>Semantic objects should always be used <em>by reference</em>. For this
    /// reason, the contracts of <see cref="Equals"/> and <see cref="GetHashCode"/>
    /// inherited from <see cref="object"/>, are frozen here.</para>
    /// <para>Furthermore, in an ideal world, to keep things under control, there should
    /// be exactly <strong>1</strong> computer object for each relevant real-world object
    /// (abstraction function should be a surjection). Duplicate representatives of
    /// real-world objects make things very hard. Sadly, in very many cicrumstances,
    /// we cannot do without multiple representatives. In any case, to guard
    /// against accidental copy proliferation, semantic objects are non-cloneable.</para>
    /// <para>Note that, as a consequence of the above, reference identity nor
    /// <see cref="Equals"/> can detect whether two semantic objects represent the
    /// same real-world object or not. If this is a concern, a semantically relevant
    /// separate method, e.g., <c>RepresentsSame(_T_ other)</c> should be added.
    /// Furthermore, note that even if another semantic object has exactly the same
    /// properties, it is not necessarily so that they both represent the same
    /// real-world object. Indeed, there <em>is</em> at least 1 other person in Belgium
    /// that has &quot;Jan Dockx&quot; as his name.</para>
    /// <para><see cref="ToString"/> should only be used for debugging and logging
    /// purposes. For semantic object, <see cref="ToString"/> should return a
    /// <see cref="string"/> that shows the class name and hash code (like
    /// <see cref="object.ToString"/> does, followed by a comma-separated list of
    /// <c>PropertyName = propertyValue</c> entries. Experience shows that this is not
    /// that hard, but that great care should be taken that no infinite loop is introduced
    /// in the code when navigating over the object graph. Therefore, the general rule
    /// should be that <em>upstream</em> reference properties are listed (usually
    /// to-one associations), but <em>downstream</em> reference properties
    /// (usually to-many associations) should not.</para>
    /// <para><see cref="AbstractSemanticObject"/> offers hard implementations that
    /// enforce the above rules. As this interface doesn't really enforce anything through
    /// the compiler, it can be seen as a tagging interface.</para>
