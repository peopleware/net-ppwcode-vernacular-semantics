    ///         classes often have only a default constructor. On the other hand
    ///         often some properties cannot be given a semantically acceptable value
    ///         at instantiation. This triggers a pattern where instances of the
    ///         semantic class can exist in a state where it does not represent a
    ///         real-world object of the type the class is intended for, i.e.,
    ///         the instances do not conform to type invariants that would apply
    ///         direct representations of the real-world objects. Such objects
    ///         are created in a <em>wild</em> state, then
    ///         go through a setup phase where a number of properties are set,
    ///         and then enter a lifecycle phase where they do represent a
    ///         real-world object of the type the class is intended for (they become
    ///         <em>civilized</em>).
    ///         Typically, by changing one or more properties, such objects
